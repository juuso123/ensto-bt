pairing (by pressing button) and running pair.py. The xxxxxxxxxxxx in the filename is the mac address 
without ":" characters. Pairing file is saved by default to same directory where script is. 

Content of file:
{"resetCode":[0,0,0,0],"deviceName": "device1"}

For example a device with name "Kylpyl√§ spa" will be renamed to "kylpylaspa" to be used as part of topic.
